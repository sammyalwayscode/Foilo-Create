      Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is
      developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants,
      enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be
      pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as
      web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g.,
      JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web
      browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array
      of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of
      intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the
      platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues
      and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct
      app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members (including the UK), 60
      percent of which are mobile app developers.[1] As part of the development
      process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the
      creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts,
      screen, input, and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the
      focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails
      components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users
      to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate
      the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints
      include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's
      screen size for a user's hand(s). Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user
      activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user
      interactions within a mobile app. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is
      mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface. The UI of mobile
      apps should: consider users' limited attention, minimize keystrokes, and
      be task-oriented with a minimum set of functions. This functionality is
      supported by mobile enterprise application platforms or integrated
      development environments (IDEs). Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile
      back-ends to support access to enterprise systems. The mobile back-end
      facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working
      off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a
      mix of middleware components including mobile app server, mobile backend
      as a service (MBaaS), and service-oriented architecture (SOA)
      infrastructure. Mobile app development is becoming more critical for many
      businesses with more than 3 billion people worldwide using smartphones,
      more than 1.5 billion using tablets as of 2019. Users, on average, spend
      90 percent of their mobile time in apps and there are more than 700
      million apps downloads from various app stores.[2]

      Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the
      Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
      development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
      text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic
      businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of
      tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
      engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
      client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
      configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals, "Web
      development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
      sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content
      management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with
      basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses, Web
      development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and
      follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web
      sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or
      contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions
      such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web
      development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than
      the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web
      developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and
      full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior
      and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal
      with the servers.

      Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
      which is unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animal.
      Leading AI literature defines the field as the study of "intelligent
      agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that
      maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[3] Colloquially,
      the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or
      computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the
      human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".[4] Investopedia
      defines AI as "the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
      programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions."[5] As machines
      become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence"
      are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI
      effect.[6] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been
      done yet."[7] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently
      excluded from things considered to be AI,[8] having become a routine
      technology.[9] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI
      include successfully understanding human speech,[10] competing at the
      highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[11]
      autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery
      networks, and military simulations.[12] Artificial intelligence was
      founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has
      experienced several waves of optimism,[13][14] followed by disappointment
      and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[15][16] followed by new
      approaches, success and renewed funding.[14][17] After AlphaGo
      successfully defeated a professional Go player in 2015, artificial
      intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention.[18] For
      most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that
      often fail to communicate with each other.[19] These sub-fields are based
      on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or
      "machine learning"),[20] the use of particular tools ("logic" or
      artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical
      differences.[23][24][25] Sub-fields have also been based on social factors
      (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[19] The
      traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning,
      knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing,
      perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[20] General
      intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.[26] Approaches include
      statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic
      AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and
      mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based
      on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer
      science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics,
      philosophy, and many other fields. The field was founded on the assumption
      that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can
      be made to simulate it".[27] This raises philosophical arguments about the
      mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like
      intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and
      philosophy since antiquity.[32] Some people also consider AI to be a
      danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[33][34] Others believe that
      AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass
      unemployment.[35]

      Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve
      automatically through experience.[1] It is seen as a subset of artificial
      intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample
      data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions
      without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning
      algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email
      filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to
      develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. A subset of
      machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which
      focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine
      learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization
      delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine
      learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory
      data analysis through unsupervised learning.[4][5] In its application
      across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as
      predictive analytics.

      User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of
      user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home
      appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus
      on maximizing usability and the user experience. The goal of user
      interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient
      as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design).
      Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without
      drawing unnecessary attention to itself. Graphic design and typography are
      utilized to support its usability, influencing how the user performs
      certain interactions and improving the aesthetic appeal of the design;
      design aesthetics may enhance or detract from the ability of users to use
      the functions of the interface.[1] The design process must balance
      technical functionality and visual elements (e.g., mental model) to create
      a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to
      changing user needs. Interface design is involved in a wide range of
      projects, from computer systems, to cars, to commercial planes; all of
      these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions yet also
      require some unique skills and knowledge. As a result, designers tend to
      specialize in certain types of projects and have skills centered on their
      expertise, whether it is a software design, user research, web design, or
      industrial design.
